ATE Web
=========

## What is ATE Web?

AteWeb is a static content web server that works by reading an ATE chain-of-trust. By
utilizing an ATE backend the following advantages exist.

- Scale out to multiple web servers that all stay in sync
- All files are cached locally for high performance
- All files can be updated in realtime by mounting the ATE chain
- Very high degree of security as all the backend data is encrypted
- No need for authentication or authorization to manage the web server.

AteWeb also includes an automation certificate generation engine using LetsEncrypt.org
