ATE SSH Server
==============

## What is ATE SSH Server?

ATE SSH server is (of course) an SSH Server but one that hosts Wasmer
terminals rather than giving direct access to the host operating system.

Specifically it provides a hosting environment for Web Assembly processes
running with full wasmer-bus support.

# Features
